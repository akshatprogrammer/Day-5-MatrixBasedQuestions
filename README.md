## Matrix Multiplication
  ### Method 1:
  Condition of Matrix Multiplication -> **Col^n of 1 Matrix = Row of 2 Matrix**</br>
  * Run a loop from 0 to R1.
  * Run inner loop from 0 to C2.
  * assign product[i]/[j]=0;
  * Run another inner loop from 0 to R2/C1.
  * Assign product[i]/[j] += A[i]/[k] * B[k]/[j];
  
  Time Complexity = O(m X n X q)
  </br>
